### **Week 9: Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) Essentials**

This week focuses on deploying, scaling, and monitoring machine learning models in production environments.

* * *

### **Day 1: Introduction to ML Deployment Concepts**

- âœ… Understand the ML lifecycle: data collection, model training, deployment, and monitoring
- âœ… Learn key deployment approaches: batch processing, real-time inference, and edge deployment

**Practice Task:** Outline a deployment strategy for a sentiment analysis model.

* * *

### **Day 2: REST API Development with Flask/FastAPI**

- âœ… Install and set up `Flask` or `FastAPI`
- âœ… Learn to build API endpoints for ML model inference
- âœ… Implement input validation and error handling

**Practice Task:** Create a simple Flask API that predicts house prices based on user input.

* * *

### **Day 3: Containerization with Docker**

- âœ… Learn Docker basics: Images, Containers, and Dockerfiles
- âœ… Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize your Flask/FastAPI app
- âœ… Understand `docker-compose` for multi-container applications

**Practice Task:** Containerize your house price prediction API using Docker.

* * *

### **Day 4: Model Versioning and Management**

- âœ… Learn to use `MLflow` for model tracking and versioning
- âœ… Understand experiment tracking and parameter logging

**Practice Task:** Train a logistic regression model, log metrics in `MLflow`, and version the model.

* * *

### **Day 5: Cloud Deployment Basics**

- âœ… Deploy a model on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure
- âœ… Learn about serverless deployment options like AWS Lambda

**Practice Task:** Deploy your Flask app to AWS using `Elastic Beanstalk` or `EC2`.

* * *

### **Day 6: Monitoring and Maintenance**

- âœ… Learn to track model drift and performance degradation
- âœ… Explore tools like `Prometheus` and `Grafana` for monitoring

**Practice Task:** Set up a basic dashboard to track API requests and model performance.

* * *

### **Day 7: Review and Mini Project**

- âœ… Consolidate all key concepts from the week
- âœ… Build a mini-project: "House Price Prediction API" that:
    - Uses a trained model for real-time predictions
    - Is containerized with Docker
    - Deployed on AWS EC2 or Azure App Service
