### **Week 11: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for ML**

This week covers essential DSA concepts to improve model performance, data processing efficiency, and coding skills for technical interviews.

* * *

### **Day 1: Introduction to DSA for ML**

- âœ… Understand the role of DSA in ML projects
- âœ… Learn about key data structures: Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues
- âœ… Practice basic array operations in Python

**Practice Task:** Implement sorting algorithms like `Bubble Sort` and `Merge Sort`.

### **Day 2: Hashing and Hash Tables**

- âœ… Learn the fundamentals of hashing
- âœ… Implement hash tables using Pythonâ€™s `dict()`
- âœ… Understand collision handling techniques like chaining

**Practice Task:** Build a simple hash table to store and retrieve ML model metadata efficiently.

### **Day 3: Graphs and Trees for ML**

- âœ… Learn about Graph and Tree data structures
- âœ… Understand BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search)
- âœ… Explore Decision Trees in ML from a DSA perspective

**Practice Task:** Implement BFS and DFS algorithms to explore a graph of connected cities.

### **Day 4: Dynamic Programming Concepts**

- âœ… Understand memoization and tabulation
- âœ… Learn to optimize recursive algorithms with dynamic programming (DP)

**Practice Task:** Solve the "Knapsack Problem" and "Longest Common Subsequence" using DP.

* * *

### **Day 5: Searching and Sorting Algorithms**

- âœ… Learn about efficient sorting algorithms: `Quick Sort`, `Heap Sort`
- âœ… Implement binary search and understand its time complexity

**Practice Task:** Use binary search to efficiently find model accuracy values in sorted performance data.

### **Day 6: Practical Applications of DSA in ML**

- âœ… Use `heapq` for efficient data retrieval
- âœ… Learn about priority queues and their use in model evaluation

**Practice Task:** Implement a priority queue to manage model training tasks based on dataset size.

* * *

### **Day 7: Review and Mini Project**

- âœ… Consolidate all key concepts from the week
- âœ… Build a mini-project: "Data Pipeline Optimizer" that:
    - Uses dynamic programming for efficient data partitioning
    - Utilizes hash tables for fast data retrieval
