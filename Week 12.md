### **Week 12: Building Your Machine Learning Portfolio**

This week focuses on creating impressive portfolio projects that showcase your ML skills effectively to potential employers.

* * *

### **Day 1: Understanding Portfolio Best Practices**

- âœ… Learn what makes a strong ML portfolio
- âœ… Understand project structure: clear README, clean code, and proper documentation
- âœ… Explore popular ML portfolio platforms like GitHub, Kaggle, and Hugging Face

**Practice Task:** Create a professional GitHub profile with a dedicated ML portfolio repository.

* * *

### **Day 2: Developing a Data Analysis Project**

- âœ… Select a real-world dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI)
- âœ… Perform data cleaning, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and visualization
- âœ… Present insights with clear visualizations and key takeaways

**Practice Task:** Build a "Customer Segmentation Analysis" project using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

* * *

### **Day 3: Creating a Predictive Model Project**

- âœ… Select a suitable ML model for a chosen dataset
- âœ… Implement data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- âœ… Document your code with comments and explanations

**Practice Task:** Develop a "Churn Prediction Model" with `scikit-learn`.

* * *

### **Day 4: Building an NLP Project**

- âœ… Use `Hugging Face Transformers` for text classification
- âœ… Integrate model deployment with `FastAPI` for real-time inference
- âœ… Document model architecture and API usage

**Practice Task:** Develop a "Fake News Detection System" using BERT.

* * *

### **Day 5: Creating a Computer Vision Project**

- âœ… Use TensorFlow/Keras to build a CNN model
- âœ… Train the model on an image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST)
- âœ… Implement Grad-CAM for model interpretability

**Practice Task:** Build an "Image Recognition App" with interactive visual outputs.

* * *

### **Day 6: Enhancing Portfolio Projects**

- âœ… Add project documentation with clear instructions
- âœ… Improve UI using `Streamlit` or `Gradio`
- âœ… Host projects on platforms like `Hugging Face Spaces` or `Heroku`

**Practice Task:** Enhance one of your projects with an interactive web app interface.

* * *

### **Day 7: Review and Final Showcase**

- âœ… Consolidate all completed projects in your portfolio repository
- âœ… Ensure clear README files with project descriptions, key insights, and installation instructions
- âœ… Prepare short presentations for showcasing your projects in interviews

**Practice Task:** Create a comprehensive README for your GitHub portfolio with links to each project.
