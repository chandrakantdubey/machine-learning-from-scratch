### 9-Month Full-Stack ML Engineer Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to transform you from a beginner (assuming basic programming knowledge in Python) into a full-stack ML engineer capable of building, deploying, and scaling AI-powered web applications. It's structured week-by-week over 36 weeks (9 months), emphasizing hands-on learning: **every major topic is tied directly to building a deployable project or mini-app**. You'll build **5 real-world apps** progressively, each incorporating new skills and reusable for your portfolio. These aren't toy projects—they're useful tools like a personal finance tracker with ML predictions, a content recommendation engine, or an image-based search app.

Key principles:
- **Project-centric**: No passive reading; learn by coding and deploying. Use free/open-source tools (e.g., GitHub for hosting, Vercel/Heroku for deployment, Streamlit/Gradio for quick UIs, Hugging Face for ML models).
- **Resource-intensive but efficient**: Focus on high-impact resources (free courses, docs, GitHub repos). Dedicate 20-30 hours/week: 40% learning, 60% building/deploying.
- **Tech stack**: Python (core), React (front-end), Node.js/Express or FastAPI (back-end), TensorFlow/PyTorch (ML), Docker/Kubernetes basics (deployment), AWS/GCP free tiers for cloud.
- **Milestones**: End each month with a deployed app iteration. Track progress on GitHub; aim for CI/CD pipelines by Month 3.
- **Prerequisites**: Install VS Code, Git, Python 3.12+, Node.js. Use Jupyter Notebooks for ML prototyping.

The roadmap is divided into phases, with a weekly breakdown. Each week includes:
- **Topics**: Core concepts to master.
- **Resources**: Targeted, non-generic (e.g., specific tutorials/repos).
- **Project/Task**: Build/deploy something useful immediately.
- **Goals**: Measurable outcomes.
