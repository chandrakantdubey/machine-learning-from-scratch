### **Day 4: Data Splitting and Model Evaluation**

- âœ… Learn about train-test split with `train_test_split()`
- âœ… Understand cross-validation for model robustness
- âœ… Practice evaluating models with metrics like RMSE, R-squared, etc.

**Practice Task:** Train and evaluate a model predicting car prices using proper data splits.

* * *

### **Day 5: Introduction to Feature Engineering**

- âœ… Understand feature scaling with `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`
- âœ… Learn about encoding categorical data using `OneHotEncoder`
- âœ… Explore feature selection techniques

**Practice Task:** Perform feature scaling and encoding on a sample dataset.

* * *

### **Day 6: Introduction to `scikit-learn` Pipelines**

- âœ… Understand the purpose of ML pipelines for streamlined workflows
- âœ… Build a pipeline combining preprocessing and model training steps

**Practice Task:** Create a pipeline for predicting student scores from study hours data.
