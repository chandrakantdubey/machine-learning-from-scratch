### **Week 10: Advanced Deployment and Scalability**

This week covers deploying models at scale, improving performance, and ensuring robustness in production environments.

* * *

### **Day 1: Advanced REST API Design**

- âœ… Learn best practices for scalable API design
- âœ… Implement pagination, caching, and request throttling
- âœ… Understand API versioning for backward compatibility

**Practice Task:** Improve your House Price Prediction API with pagination and caching mechanisms.

* * *

### **Day 2: CI/CD for Machine Learning Pipelines**

- âœ… Learn CI/CD basics using `GitHub Actions` or `Jenkins`
- âœ… Automate model deployment with version control triggers
- âœ… Understand automated testing for ML pipelines

**Practice Task:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys new model versions to your API.

* * *

### **Day 3: Scaling ML Models with Kubernetes**

- âœ… Understand Kubernetes architecture: pods, deployments, and services
- âœ… Learn to deploy your ML model using Kubernetes

**Practice Task:** Containerize your model and deploy it using Kubernetes with autoscaling enabled.

* * *

### **Day 4: Model Optimization for Speed and Efficiency**

- âœ… Optimize model inference with `ONNX` or `TensorRT`
- âœ… Learn model quantization and pruning for faster predictions

**Practice Task:** Optimize your CNN model for faster inference on edge devices.

* * *

### **Day 5: Securing ML APIs and Services**

- âœ… Implement API security best practices (e.g., OAuth2, JWT tokens)
- âœ… Set up role-based access control (RBAC) for restricted endpoints

**Practice Task:** Secure your House Price Prediction API with JWT token authentication.

* * *

### **Day 6: Advanced Monitoring and Logging**

- âœ… Implement structured logging for easier debugging
- âœ… Use `Prometheus` and `Grafana` to monitor model performance

**Practice Task:** Build a Grafana dashboard that tracks response times and prediction accuracy.

* * *

### **Day 7: Review and Mini Project**

- âœ… Consolidate all key concepts from the week
- âœ… Build a mini-project: "Real-Time Fraud Detection System" that:
    - Deploys a model with Kubernetes
    - Uses monitoring tools for tracking performance
    - Includes a secure API with JWT authentication
