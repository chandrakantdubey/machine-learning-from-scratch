### **Week 8: Computer Vision Fundamentals**

This week introduces computer vision concepts, image processing, and building image classification models.

* * *

### **Day 1: Introduction to Computer Vision**

- âœ… Understand computer vision basics: image recognition, object detection, and segmentation
- âœ… Learn about image data formats (JPEG, PNG) and color channels (RGB, Grayscale)

**Practice Task:** Load and visualize images using `OpenCV` and `matplotlib`.

* * *

### **Day 2: Image Preprocessing Techniques**

- âœ… Learn common image preprocessing steps: resizing, cropping, and normalization
- âœ… Use `OpenCV` and `PIL` for image transformations

**Practice Task:** Preprocess a set of cat and dog images for model training.

* * *

### **Day 3: Feature Extraction from Images**

- âœ… Understand edge detection techniques (e.g., Canny Edge Detector)
- âœ… Learn about Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for feature extraction

**Practice Task:** Perform edge detection and extract key features from sample images.

* * *

### **Day 4: Building an Image Classifier with CNNs**

- âœ… Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras
- âœ… Learn about convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers

**Practice Task:** Create a CNN model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

* * *

### **Day 5: Transfer Learning for Computer Vision**

- âœ… Understand the concept of transfer learning for faster training
- âœ… Use pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet

**Practice Task:** Fine-tune a pre-trained ResNet model for flower classification.

* * *

### **Day 6: Object Detection Basics**

- âœ… Understand object detection models like YOLO and SSD
- âœ… Practice detecting objects in real-world images using pre-trained YOLO models

**Practice Task:** Perform object detection on traffic sign images using YOLOv5.

* * *

### **Day 7: Review and Mini Project**

- âœ… Consolidate all key concepts from the week
- âœ… Build a mini-project: "Image Classifier Web App" that:
    - Accepts uploaded images as input
    - Classifies images using a pre-trained CNN model

* * *
