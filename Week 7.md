### **Week 7: Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

This week dives into the fundamentals of NLP, covering text processing, tokenization, and popular NLP frameworks.

* * *

### **Day 1: Introduction to NLP Concepts**

- âœ… Understand NLP basics: Tokenization, Stemming, and Lemmatization
- âœ… Learn about NLP applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation

**Practice Task:** Tokenize a sample text using `nltk` and apply stemming techniques.

* * *

### **Day 2: Text Preprocessing Techniques**

- âœ… Perform text cleaning: Removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters
- âœ… Use `nltk`, `spaCy`, or `transformers` for text processing

**Practice Task:** Clean and preprocess a dataset of customer reviews.

* * *

### **Day 3: Vectorization Techniques**

- âœ… Learn about Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
- âœ… Understand `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer` in `scikit-learn`

**Practice Task:** Vectorize a text dataset and analyze key word patterns.

* * *

### **Day 4: Sentiment Analysis**

- âœ… Learn about sentiment analysis techniques
- âœ… Implement a sentiment analysis model using `scikit-learn` or `TextBlob`

**Practice Task:** Perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews.

* * *

### **Day 5: Introduction to Transformer Models**

- âœ… Understand transformer architectures like BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa
- âœ… Learn to use the `transformers` library by Hugging Face

**Practice Task:** Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for text classification.

* * *

### **Day 6: Building an NLP Pipeline**

- âœ… Combine text cleaning, vectorization, and ML models into a complete pipeline
- âœ… Use `Pipeline` from `scikit-learn` for workflow automation

**Practice Task:** Build a pipeline that classifies spam vs. ham SMS messages.

* * *

### **Day 7: Review and Mini Project**

- âœ… Consolidate all key concepts from the week
- âœ… Build a mini-project: "Sentiment Analysis Dashboard" that:
    - Accepts user reviews as input
    - Visualizes sentiment scores and key phrase trends

* * *
