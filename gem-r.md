# The 9-Month LLM Ascent: A Beast-Mode Protocol & Tactical Plan

## Guiding Philosophy
Your life is now code, math, and research papers. Every concept is understood by implementing it from scratch. Every tool is mastered by breaking it and rebuilding it. Your competition is not your peers; it is the state-of-the-art. This is not a study plan; it is a high-intensity training protocol.
