### **Week 1: Command Line (Mastering the Terminal)**

Mastering the command line is crucial for data manipulation, package management, and deploying ML models. This week covers essential CLI skills with structured daily tasks.

* * *

### **Day 1: Introduction to Command Line Basics**

- âœ… Understand file system structure (/, /home, /etc, etc.)
    
- âœ… Learn basic commands: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`
    
- âœ… Explore command options with `man` (e.g., `man ls`)
    

**Practice Task:** Create a folder structure for your ML projects with organized subfolders (e.g., `projects`, `datasets`, `scripts`).

* * *

### **Day 2: File Manipulation Commands**

- âœ… Learn file manipulation commands: `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `cat`, `nano`
    
- âœ… Use `echo` to create files and add content quickly
    
- âœ… Learn `touch` to create empty files
    

**Practice Task:** Create, move, and delete files inside your ML folder structure.

### **Day 3: Text Processing with CLI**

- âœ… Learn `grep` for pattern matching
    
- âœ… Understand `awk` and `sed` for text processing
    
- âœ… Use `cut`, `sort`, and `uniq` for data manipulation
    

**Practice Task:** Filter and extract data from a sample `.csv` file using `grep` and `cut`.

* * *

### **Day 4: Environment Management**

- âœ… Install and configure `virtualenv` or `conda`
    
- âœ… Learn to activate/deactivate environments
    
- âœ… Practice installing packages using `pip` and `conda`
    

**Practice Task:** Create a virtual environment and install key ML libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`).

* * *

### **Day 5: Remote Server Access with SSH**

- âœ… Learn SSH basics (`ssh user@hostname`)
    
- âœ… Understand SCP for secure file transfers
    
- âœ… Practice setting up SSH keys for secure login
    

**Practice Task:** Connect to a remote server (e.g., AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean droplet) and transfer sample data files securely.

* * *

### **Day 6: Basic Shell Scripting**

- âœ… Write `.sh` scripts for automation
    
- âœ… Learn to use variables, loops, and conditions in shell scripts
    
- âœ… Understand script execution permissions using `chmod`
    

**Practice Task:** Write a script that automatically creates backup copies of your ML projects folder.

* * *

### **Day 7: Review and Practical Application**

- âœ… Consolidate all key concepts from the week
    
- âœ… Complete 3 small practice exercises:
    
    - Create and delete multiple folders in bulk using a shell script
        
    - Extract unique values from a sample dataset using `cut` and `sort`
        
    - Automate package installation with a custom `.sh` script
